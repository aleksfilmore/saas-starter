## üîç What to Test Now

### 1. Wall Functionality
1. Sign in to the application
2. Navigate to `/wall`
3. Try clicking like/reaction buttons on posts
4. Check browser console for debugging output
5. Verify reaction counts update properly

### 2. Notifications Menu
1. Click the notification bell icon in the header
2. Verify dropdown appears with proper styling
3. Check positioning doesn't overlap other elements
4. Test mark as read functionality

### 3. Voice Therapy Purchase
1. Navigate to AI therapy or dashboard
2. Find "Purchase Voice Therapy" option
3. Click to initiate Stripe checkout
4. Complete test purchase with Stripe test card
5. Verify webhook processes the purchase correctly

### 4. Clipboard Operations
1. Try copying referral links
2. Test badge sharing functionality
3. Verify fallback alerts appear if clipboard fails

### 5. Stripe Webhooks
1. Use Stripe CLI to test webhook events:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook
   stripe trigger checkout.session.completed
   ```
2. Check server logs for webhook processing
3. Verify database updates after successful webhooks

## üö® Known Limitations

### Authentication Required
- Wall likes only work for authenticated users
- Most API endpoints return 401 for unauthenticated requests
- Need to implement proper sign-in flow for full testing

### Environment Dependencies
- Stripe webhooks need to be configured in Stripe Dashboard
- Real payments require Stripe test mode configuration
- Voice therapy credits system needs database schema implementation

## üìã Next Steps

1. **Test with actual user authentication**
2. **Configure Stripe webhook endpoints in Stripe Dashboard**
3. **Implement voice therapy credit tracking in database**
4. **Add comprehensive error handling UI**
5. **Test on different browsers and devices**

## üîß Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test Stripe flows (requires server running)
node test-stripe-flows.js

# Check logs
tail -f logs/application.log

# Test Stripe webhooks locally
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:3001/api/stripe/webhook
```
