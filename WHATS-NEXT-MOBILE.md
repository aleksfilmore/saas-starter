# 🎯 What's Next: Your Mobile App Development Roadmap

## ✅ Current Status
Your React Native mobile app foundation is **100% complete** and ready for development! The infrastructure, authentication, and integration with your web platform are all set up.

## 🚀 Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Start the Mobile App** 🏃‍♂️
```bash
# Open PowerShell in mobile directory
cd C:\Users\iamal\OneDrive\Documents\GitHub\saas-starter\mobile

# Start Expo development server
npx expo start

# Alternative: Start with tunnel for wider device access
npx expo start --tunnel
```

**What this does:**
- Starts the development server
- Shows QR code for testing on device
- Enables hot reload for development

### 2. **Test on Your Phone** 📱
1. Download **Expo Go** app from App Store/Play Store
2. Scan the QR code from terminal
3. Your app will load with the "Healing Journey Mobile" welcome screen
4. Test authentication by signing in with your web platform credentials

### 3. **Create Essential App Assets** 🎨
```bash
# Navigate to mobile assets folder
cd mobile/assets

# You need to create these images:
# - icon.png (1024x1024) - App icon
# - splash.png (1284x2778) - Splash screen
# - adaptive-icon.png (1024x1024) - Android icon
# - favicon.png (32x32) - Web favicon
```

**Quick Fix:** Use online tools like [Figma](https://figma.com) or [Canva](https://canva.com) to create these with your brand colors:
- Background: `#080F20` (dark)
- Primary: `#8B5FE6` (purple)
- Accent: `#FF1B7A` (pink)

### 4. **Build Core Mobile Screens** 📺

Start with these essential screens:

```bash
# Create these files in mobile/screens/
screens/
├── auth/
│   ├── WelcomeScreen.tsx     # Onboarding
│   ├── SignInScreen.tsx      # Login (already started)
│   └── SignUpScreen.tsx      # Registration
├── dashboard/
│   └── DashboardScreen.tsx   # Main dashboard
├── rituals/
│   └── RitualsScreen.tsx     # Daily rituals
└── profile/
    └── ProfileScreen.tsx     # User profile
```

### 5. **Test Cross-Platform Sync** 🔄
1. Start web platform: `npm run dev`
2. Start mobile app: `cd mobile && npx expo start`
3. Sign in on web platform
4. Sign in on mobile with same credentials
5. Verify data sync between platforms

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Daily Development Process
```bash
# Terminal 1: Web Platform
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Mobile App
cd mobile
npx expo start
```
