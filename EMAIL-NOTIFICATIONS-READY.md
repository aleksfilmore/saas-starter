```

✅ **No additional configuration needed - uses existing email setup!**

The system uses the existing Resend API configuration and is ready for production use.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ ~~Configure Resend API key~~ - Already working!
2. Set up cron job for daily email reminders (if needed)
3. Monitor email delivery rates and user engagement
4. Consider adding more email templates (weekly summaries, milestone celebrations, etc.)

## Architecture

```
Email Notification Flow:
1. User enables email notifications in settings
2. Daily cron job (or manual trigger) calls sendBulkDailyReminders()
3. System checks all users with emailNotifications = true
4. For each user:
   - Fetches user data and streak information
   - Gets today's ritual preview
   - Generates personalized email
   - Sends via Resend API
   - Includes unsubscribe token
5. Logs results and handles errors gracefully
```

The email notifications system is production-ready and follows best practices for user privacy, unsubscribe handling, and error management.
