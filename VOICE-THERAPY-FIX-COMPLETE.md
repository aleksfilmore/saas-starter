# Voice AI Therapy Purchase Fix - Complete Implementation

## Issue Summary
The Voice AI Therapy purchase button in the modal was not working because the entire voice therapy credit system was incomplete. Users could not purchase or use voice therapy services.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Missing Database Schema**: No voice therapy credits tables existed
2. **Incomplete API Implementation**: Credits checking always returned false
3. **Non-functional Webhook**: Stripe payments weren't granting actual credits
4. **Missing Session Tracking**: No way to deduct minutes when sessions ended

## Complete Fix Implementation

### 1. Database Schema Enhancement
**Added Tables:**
```sql
-- Voice therapy credits table
CREATE TABLE voice_therapy_credits (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  minutes_purchased INTEGER NOT NULL,
  minutes_remaining INTEGER NOT NULL, 
  purchase_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  expiry_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL, -- 30 days from purchase
  stripe_session_id TEXT,
  is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true
);

-- Voice therapy sessions tracking
CREATE TABLE voice_therapy_sessions (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  credit_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES voice_therapy_credits(id),
  minutes_used INTEGER NOT NULL,
  session_start TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
  session_end TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  persona TEXT,
  summary TEXT
);
```

**Performance Indexes:**
- `idx_voice_therapy_credits_user_id` 
- `idx_voice_therapy_credits_active` (user_id, is_active, expiry_date)
- `idx_voice_therapy_sessions_user_id`
- `idx_voice_therapy_sessions_credit_id`

### 2. API Endpoints Fixed

**`/api/voice-therapy/credits` (GET)**
- Now queries actual database for user's active credits
- Checks expiry dates and remaining minutes
- Returns accurate credit status

**`/api/voice-therapy/start` (POST)**  
- Validates user has sufficient credits before starting
- Returns available minutes for session planning
- Prevents sessions without credits

**`/api/voice-therapy/end` (POST)**
- Deducts actual minutes used from user's credits
- Records session in database for analytics
- Handles credit exhaustion gracefully
- Uses smart credit allocation (uses credits with most minutes first)

### 3. Stripe Integration Completed

**Webhook Enhancement (`/api/stripe/webhook`)**
```typescript
// Now actually grants credits on successful payment
if (productType === 'voice_therapy') {
  const sessionDuration = parseInt(session.metadata?.sessionDuration || '15');
  const expiryDate = new Date();
  expiryDate.setDate(expiryDate.getDate() + 30);
  
  await db.insert(voiceTherapyCredits).values({
    id: randomUUID(),
    userId: userId,
    minutesPurchased: sessionDuration,
    minutesRemaining: sessionDuration,
    purchaseDate: new Date(),
    expiryDate: expiryDate,
    stripeSessionId: session.id,
    isActive: true
  });
}
```

**Purchase Flow (`/api/stripe/voice-therapy`)**
- Creates Stripe checkout session for $9.99
- Includes proper metadata for webhook processing
- Handles success/cancel redirects correctly

### 4. Schema Integration
**Updated `lib/db/schema.ts`:**
- Added `voiceTherapyCredits` and `voiceTherapySessions` tables
- Added TypeScript types for full type safety
- Proper foreign key relationships
- UUID generation for primary keys

### 5. Complete Purchase-to-Usage Flow

**Purchase Journey:**
1. User clicks "Purchase Voice Therapy" ‚Üí Stripe checkout
2. Payment success ‚Üí Webhook grants 15 minutes + 30-day expiry
3. User can see credits in modal (hasCredits: true, remainingMinutes: 15)
4. User starts session ‚Üí API validates credits exist
5. User ends session ‚Üí Minutes deducted, session recorded
6. Credits expire after 30 days or when exhausted

## Testing Results

**‚úÖ All Systems Operational:**
- Stripe configuration: All environment variables set correctly
- Database: Tables created and accessible  
- API endpoints: Properly authenticated and functional
- Webhook: Processing voice therapy purchases
- Credit system: Full purchase-to-usage lifecycle

**‚úÖ Payment Flow Validation:**
- Voice therapy checkout: Returns proper Stripe URL
- Credits checking: Database-backed validation
- Session management: Proper minute deduction
- Webhook processing: Automatic credit granting

## User Experience Impact

**Before Fix:**
- Purchase button did nothing
- No way to buy or use voice therapy
- Credits always showed as unavailable

**After Fix:**
- üéØ Purchase button redirects to Stripe checkout
- üí≥ Successful payments grant 15 minutes (30-day validity)
- üîç Modal shows accurate credit status  
- ‚è±Ô∏è Sessions properly track and deduct time
- üìä Full audit trail of purchases and usage

## Technical Architecture

**Database Layer:**
- `voice_therapy_credits`: Purchase tracking with expiry
- `voice_therapy_sessions`: Usage analytics and audit

**API Layer:**
- Credits endpoint: Real-time balance checking
- Session endpoints: Start/stop with validation
- Stripe webhook: Automatic credit provisioning

**Frontend Integration:**
- Modal shows actual credit status
- Purchase flow seamlessly integrated
- Session timer with real deductions

## Security & Business Logic

**‚úÖ Safeguards Implemented:**
- Credits expire after 30 days
- Cannot start sessions without credits

- User isolation (can only access own credits)

**‚úÖ Business Rules:**
- $9.99 for 15 minutes (per Stripe configuration)
- 30-day validity period
- Premium users only (Firewall tier required)
- Minutes are non-transferable and non-refundable

## Summary

The Voice AI Therapy system is now **fully functional** with complete database integration, Stripe payment processing, and proper session management. Users can successfully:

1. **Purchase** voice therapy credits through Stripe
2. **Use** credits for actual therapy sessions  
3. **Track** remaining time and expiry dates
4. **Audit** their usage history

The issue has been **completely resolved** - the purchase button now works seamlessly and integrates with a robust credit management system.
