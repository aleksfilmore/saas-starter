/**
 * Login Test Instructions
 * 
 * 1. Go to http://localhost:3000/sign-up
 * 2. Create a new account with:
 *    - Email: yourtest@email.com  
 *    - Password: password123
 * 
 * 3. Then try to login at http://localhost:3000/sign-in with those same credentials
 * 
 * If signup works but login doesn't, we know the issue is specifically in the login flow.
 * If neither works, the issue is in the database connection or schema.
