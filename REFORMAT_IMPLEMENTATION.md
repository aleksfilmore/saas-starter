# REFORMAT PROTOCOLâ„¢ - Implementation Plan

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Updates Needed

1. **Enhanced Database Schema**
   - User profile expansion (codename, avatar, attachment style, distress level)
   - Gamification system (XP, bytes, streak tracking)
   - Ritual system (daily assignments, completions)
   - Wall of Wounds (anonymous posts, reactions)
   - Subscription tiers (Ghost, Firewall, Cult Leader)

2. **Authentication & Onboarding Flow**
   - Multi-step onboarding wizard
   - Personality assessments integration
   - Codename generation system
   - Avatar selection interface

3. **Core Features to Build**
   - Glow-Up Console (main dashboard)
   - Daily ritual system
   - Wall of Wounds (confessional feed)
   - XP/Byte gamification
   - AI tools integration
   - Subscription management

## IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITIES

### Sprint 1: Enhanced Database & User System

- [ ] Create onboarding flow database tables
- [ ] Implement codename generation system

### Sprint 2: Onboarding Experience
- [ ] Multi-step wizard UI
- [ ] Attachment style assessment
- [ ] Avatar selection system
- [ ] Program path selection

### Sprint 3: Core Dashboard
- [ ] Glow-Up Console design
- [ ] XP/Byte display system
- [ ] Daily ritual cards
- [ ] Streak tracking

### Sprint 4: Wall of Wounds
- [ ] Anonymous posting system
- [ ] Reaction system (resonate, same loop, etc.)
- [ ] Glitch taxonomy tagging
- [ ] Feed algorithm

### Sprint 5: Gamification & AI
- [ ] Ritual completion system

## TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

1. **User Privacy & Anonymity**
   - Separate anonymous posting IDs from user accounts
   - Encrypted data storage for sensitive content
   - Clear data boundaries between anonymous and identified content

2. **Scalability**
   - Database indexing for feed queries
   - Caching strategies for gamification data
   - API rate limiting for AI tools

3. **Subscription Integration**
   - Stripe integration for payments
   - Feature flagging by tier
   - Usage tracking and limits

## NEXT STEPS
1. Update database schema for full gamification system
2. Create onboarding flow components
3. Design Glow-Up Console interface
4. Implement core ritual system
5. Build Wall of Wounds anonymous posting
