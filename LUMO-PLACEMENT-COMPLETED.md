# LUMO Placement - Completed ✅

## Summary
Successfully restricted LUMO (AI Assistant) to only appear on dashboard pages, removing it from marketing and authentication flows.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed LUMO from Global Layout
- **File**: `app/layout.tsx`
- **Action**: Removed `LumoProvider` and `Lumo` imports and components
- **Result**: LUMO no longer appears globally on every page

### 2. Added LUMO to Dashboard Layout Only
- **File**: `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` - Server component with metadata
- **File**: `app/dashboard/layout-client.tsx` - Client component with LUMO
- **Action**: Created dashboard-specific layout that includes LUMO
- **Result**: LUMO only appears on `/dashboard/*` routes

## Page Distribution

### ✅ Pages WITHOUT LUMO (as intended)
- **Homepage** (`/`) - Marketing page, no interference
- **Sign-in** (`/sign-in`) - Authentication flow, no interference  
- **Quiz** (`/quiz`) - User onboarding, no interference
- **AI Therapy** (`/ai-therapy`) - Dedicated AI chat, no interference with therapy AI
- **Daily Rituals** (`/daily-rituals`) - Focused ritual experience, no interference
- **Wall** (`/wall`) - Community space, clean experience
- **Other authenticated pages** - Clean, focused experiences

### ✅ Pages WITH LUMO (as intended)
- **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) - Main hub, LUMO provides guidance
- **Dashboard Console** (`/dashboard/glow-up-console`) - Advanced features, LUMO assists
- **All `/dashboard/*` routes** - Consistent LUMO experience in dashboard area

## Benefits
1. **Clean Marketing Flow** - No AI interruptions during user acquisition
2. **Focused Therapy Experience** - AI Therapy has dedicated space without LUMO conflict
3. **Distraction-Free Rituals** - Users can focus on healing practices
4. **Strategic LUMO Placement** - Available where users need navigation help (dashboard)
5. **Consistent UX** - LUMO appears consistently in dashboard area only

## Technical Implementation
- Uses Next.js layout hierarchy for clean separation
- Server/client component split maintains metadata exports
- No global state pollution from LUMO
- Efficient code splitting - LUMO bundle only loads for dashboard routes

## Testing Confirmed
✅ Homepage - No LUMO  
✅ Sign-in - No LUMO  
✅ Quiz - No LUMO  
✅ AI Therapy - No LUMO  
✅ Dashboard - LUMO present (after authentication)

The implementation successfully isolates LUMO to dashboard pages while keeping other experiences clean and focused.
